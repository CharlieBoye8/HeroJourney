(A man walks into a ghost town overrun with fungus)

YUPA      Another village has died...
YUPA      Let's go...  This place, too, will soon sink into the Fukai.

--------------------------------

INSET     1000 years after the collapse of a giant industrial civilization,
          rust and ceramic fragments covered the land.  Over this wasteland,
          a deadly forest of fungi that released poisonous vapors (miasmas),
          which came to be called the "Fukai" (Spoiled Sea), spread and was
          threatening the very existence of the declining human race.

Title: Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa  (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind)

----------------------------

(Nausicaa is flying over the wasteland on her glider, Mehve.  She lands at the
edge of Fukai and enters the forest)

NAUSICAA  A path of an Ohmu...  It's still fresh...  (She follows the track)
NAUSICAA  A cast-off skin [ALT: shell; exuviae] of an Ohmu...  How
          magnificent...!  This is the first time I've ever seen a perfectly
          shed skin.  (She taps the shell with her ceramic sword)
NAUSICAA  Good sound...  (She strikes the shell; the sword does not causes any
          significant cut)
NAUSICAA  The ceramic sword got chipped.  The Valley people will be happy.
          They wouldn't have to worry about materials to make tools out of for
          quite some time.
NAUSICAA  An amazing eye...  Maybe I can fly back with this one...  She frees
          the eye covering)
NAUSICAA  Ah, got it!  How light <it is>!

(Spores are falling in snow-like fashion)

NAUSICAA  The mushibayashi [a plant name] is spreading its afternoon spores.
          How beautiful... <even> though this place is a forest of death where,
          if not for this mask, my lungs would decay in five minutes. [pause]
          ...!!    Who is it?!  [pause]  What can it be?  My heart is pounding.
          (She hears blast of guns)
NAUSICAA  It's an insect gun!  Someone is being attacked by the insects.

(She runs to find a better vantage point)

NAUSICAA  Oh!  Sorry!
NAUSICAA  What a smoke of spores...  Ohmu!!  It must be the owner of that shed
          skin.  (Observing the path of the Ohmu, and hence the path of the
          human,)
NAUSICAA  You mustn't go [LT: escape] that way!  (She fires a signal flare)
NAUSICAA  Please, see the signal!  He answered!  He's coming this way!

(She takes to the air aboard Mehve, and soon finds a rider fleeing from the
forest)

NAUSICAA  That's...!  (A huge Ohmu crashes out from the forest in pursuit of
          the man)
NAUSICAA  What a splendid Ohmu...  (to Yupa) To the windward side!
YUPA      Thanks! [LT: Sorry]
NAUSICAA  Ohmu!  Go back to the forest.  This side isn't your world.  See?
          ["Ne?": expression used in soliciting an agreement]
          Be a good child. [pause]
          He's forgotten himself with anger.  I must calm him.  (Nausicaa drops
          flare bombs)
YUPA      The Ohmu has lost consciousness from the flare!  (Nausicaa circles
          the Ohmu, holding a strange noisemaker)
YUPA      An insect-whistle...
NAUSICAA  Ohmu, open your eyes...  Let's go back to the forest.  It's awake!
YUPA      The Ohmu is going back to the forest...  With only flare bombs and a
          insect-whistle, she managed to calm the Ohmu...
--------------------------------

(Hill top; Nausicaa lands and runs to Yupa)

NAUSICAA  Master Yupa!
YUPA      Nausicaa, you've grown!  [LT: you've visually changed; I've mistook
          you for another]
NAUSICAA  It has been a year and a half!  Father will be delighted.
YUPA      I must thank you.  You've become a fine wind-user.
NAUSICAA  No,  Father says not yet.  (Nausicaa notices something in Yupa's belt
          pouch)
YUPA      Oh, yes...  I completely forgot about this fellow.
NAUSICAA  My!  A fox-squirrel.
YUPA      This fellow was kidnapped by a bird-louse.  I mistook him for a human
          baby and I ended up using my gun.
NAUSICAA  So that's why the Ohmu was so angry.
YUPA      It seems he didn't inhale the poison because he was unconscious.  No,
          you shouldn't put out your hand like that.  He's small, but still
          ferocious.
NAUSICAA  Come...
YUPA      Hey!
NAUSICAA  There's nothing to fear.  There's nothing to fear.  (The fox-
          squirrel bites Nausicaa)
NAUSICAA  ...!!  There's nothing to fear.  See? ["Ne?"] (After a while, fox-
          squirrel releases Nausicaa's finger)
NAUSICAA  You were only scared, weren't you?  Master Yupa, won't you give him
          to me?
YUPA      Ah...  I won't mind, but...
NAUSICAA  Waa!  [expression indicating excitement]   Thank you!  (She runs to
          the riding beasts)
NAUSICAA  Kai and Kui.  Do you remember me?
YUPA      Such a mysterious power...  [The word is "Fushigi" and encompasses
          nuances of words like mysterious, strange, wonderful, and mystical.
          Just plain "mysterious" does not explain the word "fushigi" well]
NAUSICAA  <Are you guys> tired?  You've ran a lot!
YUPA      Is everyone the same?  [LT: There's no change in everyone?]  (Notices
          Nausicaa's mood change)  What's the matter...?
NAUSICAA  It's Father!  Father cannot fly any more...
YUPA      Jhil...?  The forest's poison...?
NAUSICAA  Yes...  It is the destiny of all who live near the Fukai, or so I'm
          told.
YUPA      I should have visited earlier.
NAUSICAA  No...  It was really good of you to come...  Teacher!  Later, I want
          you to look at something.  My secret room!  Don't tell anyone lest
          they be frightened.
YUPA      Oho...
NAUSICAA  I'll go on ahead to tell <everyone> you are here.  You hurry, too.
          (Brandishing her find,)
NAUSICAA  Master Yupa!!  Would you please carry this for me?  The air currents
          get disrupted so I can't fly well <with it>.
YUPA      My, she reads [ALT: understands] the wind well.  Come, just a little
          further.
--------------------------------

(Later, in the Valley of the Wind)

GOLL      Master Yupa!
OLD UNCLE Welcome!
YUPA      Is everyone well?
GOLL      Both water and wind are calm, without an incident.
CHILD     Master Yupa!
YUPA      Ah, is everyone well?
GUARD     Master Yupa.
VILLAGER  It's Master Yupa.
VILLAGER  We've been waiting for you, Master Yupa.
VILLAGER  Welcome back.

(Nausicaa is repairing a windmill blade)

MITO      Princess!  He's arrived!
NAUSICAA  Just a second.
MITO      Master Yupa!!
YUPA      Uncle Mito!  Working hard, I see.
MITO      Tell us some more of those foreign stories tonight!
NAUSICAA  Ok.  Turn it.
MITO      It looks good.
NAUSICAA  Yes.

(On the ground, people are admiring the Ohmu's eye case)

GOLL      Oh, it's a really good one.  We must set out first thing tomorrow to
          get it.
NAUSICAA  Okay, Toeto?
TOETO     Yes.
NAUSICAA  Master Yupa, this is Toeto's child that was born this year.
YUPA      Oh, let me see.  She's a fine girl.  Reminds me of Nausicaa when she
          was young.
TOETO     Would you please be this child's godfather?
OLD WOMAN So that a good wind will always blow for her...
YUPA      I accept.  I'll give her a good name.
TOETO     Thank you.  May she grow as healthy as the Princess...
MITO      Hm!  If we're talking about health, the Princess is famous for it.
          But it would be a problem if the child comes to imitate the
          Princess's Fukai playing as well.
NAUSICAA  But thanks to that <playing>, I found the shell of the Ohmu.
MITO      Well, put yourself in my shoes as the Steward.  I can't sleep easily
          [ALT: peacefully] at night from worry.
GOLL      If we're talking about Ohmu's shells, we can't quite say that the
          Princess's Fukai playing is all for nothing.
YUPA      That's true.  I was rescued, too, wasn't I?
--------------------------------

(Jhil's room in the castle)

JHIL      Saved by this child...?
YUPA      This valley is good...  Whenever I come here, my heart is consoled
          [ALT: soothed].
JHIL      How were your travels this time?
YUPA      It's terrible.  In the South, two more countries have been swallowed
          by the Fukai.  The Fukai is steadily expanding.  But wherever I go,
          there's only hunger and warfare.  Just ominous shadows.  Why can't
          they live like this valley?
GRNDMOTHR It's because here we are protected by the Lord Wind [ALT:  blessed
          wind] that blows from the sea.  The poisons from the forest cannot
          reach this valley.
JHIL      How about it, Yupa.  Why don't you settle in this valley soon?  I'm
          in this condition...  Everyone would be happy...
GRNDMOTHR That's impossible.  Yupa is a man destined to continue his search.
YUPA      Destiny, you say...?
NAUSICAA  Grandmother, what do you mean by "search"?
GRNDMOTHR My my...  You didn't know, Nausicaa?  There - It's that tapestry on
          the wall.  I can't see it any more, but it's the lord on the left
          corner.
          "That one, wearing a robe of blue, shall descend onto a golden field.
          To forge once again the lost bond with the land."
NAUSICAA  "And lead everyone, at last, to a land of blue purity..."  Master
          Yupa, I thought that it was only an old legend [ALT: ancient lore]
YUPA      Grandmother!  You vex me with your teasing.
GRNDMOTHR Same thing, isn't it?
YUPA      I only want to solve the riddle of the Fukai...  Are we, the human
          race, a species destined to be swallowed by the Fukai and be
          destroyed...?  I want to see and judge for myself.
--------------------------------

(In Nausicaa's room)

NAUSICAA  If only I could help Master Yupa...
--------------------------------

(That night)

MITO      Princess...  Princess!
NAUSICAA  What, Mito?
MITO      Goll says he smells something in the wind.
NAUSICAA  It's almost dawn <isn't it>...  I'll be right there.

(Atop the castle)

NAUSICAA  Good work.  ["Gokuro^sama" ET: Thanks for the toil]
GOLL      It's a good storm, but something's strange...
NAUSICAA  ...!  There!!  There, again!  It's a plane.
MITO      Why would a plane be in a borderland like this...
YUPA      What's happening?
MITO      Master Yupa!  It's a plane.
YUPA      A plane?!
NAUSICAA  It's coming!
MITO      It's big!
YUPA      It's a giant <sized> Torumekian ship!
NAUSICAA  The way it's flying is strange...!  It's trying to make an emergency
          landing [ALT: forced landing].  Goll!  Get me up!
MITO      Princess!  That's absurd!
NAUSICAA  I'll guide them to the coast!
YUPA      They've turned around!
GOLL      Here goes.

(Teto jumps onto Nausicaa's shoulder just before the catapult launches Mehve
into the air)

NAUSICAA  Teto...!

(A swarm of ground insects -caterpillar like- are attacking the plane and
causing damages)

NAUSICAA  How could they?  They <must have> landed in the Fukai and killed some
          insects.  Raise your rudder!!  You're going to crash!!  Raise your
          rudder!!  Your rudder...!!
--------------------------------

(Explosion.  On the castle roof)

YUPA      It fell...
MITO      Princess...!
GOLL      It's the seaside cliff!
MITO      Let's go!!
VOICE     Move it, let's go!!  All who're able, hurry up!!
--------------------------------

(At the crash site)

NAUSICAA  It's that girl!  She's alive...!
RASTEL    Where...?
NAUSICAA  The Valley of the Wind...  You mustn't speak!
RASTEL    I am Rastel of Pejite...  The cargo...  Please burn the cargo...!
NAUSICAA  The cargo?
RASTEL    Please ...  Burn it...
NAUSICAA  The cargo.  I understand.  It's all right.  Everything burned.
RASTEL    Good...
MITO      Princess!
MITO      This lady...!  She's a princess of the royal house of Pejite...
--------------------------------

(From the center of the tumult,)

MAN       An insect!!  An Ushiyabu was alive!!
MAN       Damn!  It's calling other insects!
MAN       It's hurt and can't fly.
MAN       Bring your guns here!
MAN       It's no use!  If we shoot, it'll call more of its kind!
MAN       I'll kill it on the first shot.
MAN       You can't kill an Ushiyabu with a gun!
MAN       Then what?
NAUSICAA  Wait!  Mito, <please> bring the Mehve.
MITO      Yes!
MAN       Princess!  (Nausicaa takes out her insect-whistle)
NAUSICAA  Go back to the forest...  It's all right!  You can fly.  Yes, that's
          a good child...
MITO      Princess!
NAUSICAA  Thanks.  (She tosses the insect-whistle up into the air, and the
          Ushiyabu takes flight.  Leading the insect, Nausicaa heads for the
          Fukai)
MITO      I'm glad...  We don't know what would happen if we killed even one of
          them...
          [The alternative, "if even one of them is killed", does not
          specifically imply humans as the killers.  For this reason, the
          preceding sentence should be left as is, even though it is a bit
          awkward]
--------------------------------

(In the wasteland, an Ohmu awaits)

NAUSICAA  Ohmu...
--------------------------------

(In the air, war planes signal each other)
--------------------------------

(In the Valley, the fields are being searched for spores)

BOY       Found it!  Over here!  Here it is.  There were spores on that ship
          after all.
MAN       They haven't given off any poisons yet?  (Torches spore) Just a
          little more.
BOY       Yup.  If even one remains, it would be a disaster.  (At the
          smouldering remains of the crash)
MAN       What do you suppose this lump is...?
MAN       It didn't burn even in that fire.
MITO      Well, everybody, we'll return to the investigation of this thing
          later.  Please go help burn the spores.  Be extra careful.  [pause]
          Really, what a troublesome thing they've managed to transport in <to
          this valley>.
YUPA      Mito, look here.
MITO      It's moving...  It's as if it's alive.  Master Yupa, this is...?
YUPA      In the midst of my travels, I heard of an ominous rumor...  It said
          that a monster from the ancient world had been excavated from beneath
          the city of Pejite where it had been sleeping.
MITO      A monster from the ancient world?
YUPA      It's a God Soldier [LT: Giant God Soldier].
MITO      A God Soldier?!  You mean, the ones that burned the world in the
          Seven Days of Fire...?!  This thing ...!
YUPA      All God Soldiers should have become fossils.  But this one managed to
          sleep underground for 1000 years.
MITO      It does seem to have a human form, now that you've told me.
YUPA      Torumekia is a large military state in the far West.  And with these
          dead captives from Pejite...  It bothers me...
--------------------------------

(Near the forest of the Valley)

NAUSICAA  Please take care of the rest.  [pause] What can it be...?  (Planes
          appear, scattering the people)
NAUSICAA  It's a Torumekian ship.  Everyone, to the castle!  (From the landed
          planes, armored soldiers is getting off)
NAUSICAA  Everyone!  To the castle!!  Everyone, go to the castle!! [LT:  gather
          at the castle; meet at the castle]
          To the castle!!  (Seeing a plane dispatching troops into the castle,)
NAUSICAA  Father!!
--------------------------------

(In the castle.  Jhil takes out a sword)

JHIL      Hide, Grandmother.
GRNDMOTHR I'll stay here.

(As she approaches the castle, Nausicaa hears gun shots)

WOMAN     Princess!?

(Bursting into Jhil's apartment, Nausicaa finds Torumekian soldiers standing
over her father's body)

NAUSICAA  How dare you...!!  [LT: self; ET: you]

(She attacks.  As she finishes off the guards, new armored soldiers arrive.
She evades an attack and leaps back.  Finding her father's sword, she charges)

GRNDMOTHR Nausicaa!

(Yupa leaps between Nausicaa and the invading soldiers)

YUPA      You!  Don't move!!  If you do, this knife shaved from the very shell
          of an Ohmu will pierce your ceramic armor.
SOLDIER   (To Kushana) That man... is Yupa.
YUPA      I ask the Torumekian army.  Last night, the people of this valley
          worked furiously to save your ship.
YUPA      Even now, we just finished carefully burying the dead.  Though <this
          country> is small, is this the courtesy of Torumekia towards
          such a country?!  If you're starting a war, there must be a reason.
          You should first send a messenger and state <whatever> your
          objections <are>.  (Quietly, to Nausicaa)  Nausicaa...  Calm down,
          Nausicaa.  If we fight now, everyone in the valley will be murdered.
          We must remain alive and wait for our chance.
KUROTOWA  Oof...  That wench...!
KUSHANA   Stop it, Kurotowa.
KUROTOWA  But...! Oh hell... What a fiend! [ALT: What a bitch]
          She killed off *everyone*!
KUSHANA   Your admonition pains my ears...  Aren't you Yupa Miralda, the best
          swordsman in the borderlands?  Our objective is not massacre.  I want
          to talk.  <I ask that you> sheathe your sword.
--------------------------------

(Outside the castle, the people have been gathered under guard.  Kushana is
standing on a tank facing of them.  Nausicaa walks up to the tank)

MITO      It's the Princess!
MAN       Princess!
KUROTOWA  Listen!  It is the words of Her Highness Kushana, Commander of the
          borderland expeditionary force of the Torumekian Empire!
KUSHANA   We have come to unite the borderland countries to construct a land
          without worry. [LT: Big and leisurely way].  You are on the verge of
          being destroyed by the Fukai.  Obey us, and cooperate in our
          undertaking!  Burn down the Fukai and once again revive this land!
UNCLE     Burn down the Fukai?
UNCLE     Is that possible?
KUSHANA   We have revived the miraculous skills and powers that have once made
          the human race the masters of this planet.  To those who obey me, I
          promise a livelihood without fear of the forest poisons or the
          insects!
GRNDMOTHR Wait!

(Grandmother walks up to the tank and faces Kushana)

GRNDMOTHR You must not raise a hand against the Fukai!
KUROTOWA  Who is this old crone?  Hey!  Take her away!
KUSHANA   Let her speak...
GRNDMOTHR Thousand years since the birth of the Fukai... Humans have frequently
          attempted to burn down the Fukai.  But every time, a herd of Ohmu,
          maddened with anger, converged to become a giant wave that covered
          the land and came as a flood [ALT: maddened with anger, came at an
          onslaught as one wave]
          Destroying countries, swallowing up cities...  The Ohmu continued
          to run until their own lives expired from starvation.  In due time,
          using Ohmu's corpses as the seed-beds, the spores dropped their roots
          to the earth and vast lands were swallowed by the Fukai...
          You must not touch the Fukai...
KUROTOWA  Shut up!  I won't allow such raving!
GRNDMOTHR Well, what will you do?  Kill me?
KUROTOWA  Y-You <bitch>!  ["Kisama": "You", but a nastier term; curse-like]
GRNDMOTHR Go ahead, kill me!  I'm a blind old woman; it's simple!  Like <the
          way> you killed Jhil...
MITO      Lord Jhil?!
MAN       Lord Jhil was ill!
VILLAGERS Murderers!  Murderers!!
KUROTOWA  Quiet them!  Don't be lenient with those who defy.
NAUSICAA  Everyone, wait!  Please listen to me...!  I don't want to create any
          more casualties...
MITO      Princess...
NAUSICAA  Please understand as well, Grandmother.  Let's obey these people.
--------------------------------

(The God Soldier is being hauled by the village people to the castle)

KUSHANA   It's a pretty nice valley, don't you think...?
KUROTOWA  I'm opposed to this.  Our orders are to transport the God Soldier
          back to our native country as soon as possible.
KUSHANA   The orders cannot be carried out.  Even the giant <sized> ship could
          not bear the weight of that thing and crashed.
KUROTOWA  But...  You can't be serious to establish a state [ALT: nation]
          here...
KUSHANA   And what if I am?  Are you saying we should make that monster the
          play-thing of those fools back home?
KUROTOWA  Well, I could understand that, but... (Snaps to attention,) I am no
          more than a simple soldier.  I would be overstepping my privilege in
          such a decision.  [ALT: Such decision would be beyond my station]
KUSHANA   Hmph!  Fox...!  [LT: Badger]  I will return to Pejite.  In my
          absence, pour all efforts into reviving the God Soldier.
KUROTOWA  Yes, ma'am!
KUSHANA   Is this gun ship usable?
KUROTOWA  Yes, it's a find.
--------------------------------

(In Kushana's makeshift headquarters)

KUSHANA   Don't mistake me.  I am not consulting you.
MITO      But...!  Taking the Princess to Pejite...
GOLL      Five hostages, the gunship, and food, you say...
KUSHANA   I'll leave the selection <of hostages> up to you.  Complete the
          preparation by departure, tomorrow morning. [ALT: the preparation in
          time to depart tomorrow morning]
--------------------------------

(In the hanger)

YUPA      Thanks for being the hostages.
MITO      Never mind us...  Please look.  They're intending to take everything.
YUPA      I will leave this place for the time being.  I'll return secretly and
          wait for an opportunity.  We must stop the revival of that monster at
          all costs.
MITO      Yes.
--------------------------------

(Yupa knocks on Nausicaa's door)

YUPA      Nausicaa.  (Hearing no reply, he enters)
YUPA      Teto, where is your mistress?

(Yupa follows Teto to a room under the castle)

YUPA      Nausicaa, what is the meaning of this? These are plants from the
          Fukai!
NAUSICAA  I gathered the spores and raised them.  It's all right.  They're not
          giving off any vapor [ALT: miasma].
YUPA      Not giving off poison...!?  Although the air in here is certainly
          pure...  Why?!  Even when this venomous Hisokusari plant has
          flowered?!
NAUSICAA  The water used here is brought up from 500 meters underground by the
          castle's giant windmill.  I gathered the sand from the bottom of the
          same well.  I've found out that the Fukai's plants don't give off
          poison with clean water and soil... It's the soil that's polluted!
          Even the soil of this valley is polluted.  Why!?  Who could have done
          this to the world?
YUPA      You found that out all by yourself?
NAUSICAA  Yes...  <Because> I wanted to cure Father's and everyone's illness.
          But...  I will close this place soon.  I've stopped the water a
          little while ago, so everything should soon wither away.  (Nausicaa
          goes to Yupa crying)
YUPA      Nausicaa...!
NAUSICAA  I...  I'm afraid of myself...  I don't know what I will do in anger!
          I don't want to kill anyone else...!
--------------------------------

(The next day, just before takeoff)

GIRL      Princess [ALT: Sister-Princess]!  Princess!  We've gathered these
          Chico nuts...  We give them to you, Princess!
NAUSICAA  Everyone...!  So many...  It must have been hard...  Thank you...
          I'll eat them with care.
GIRL      Poor Princess!
GUARD     Hurry and get on board!  We're departing!!
NAUSICAA  Come...  Everyone.  Don't cry any more... It's OK.  I'll come right
          back.
GIRL      Really?
NAUSICAA  Hey, have I ever told you a lie?
GIRL      No...
NAUSICAA  Ne?
GIRL      Really?
NAUSICAA  Yes.  Come, it will be dangerous <to stand around here>.
GIRLS     Promise!! [LT: For sure.  They are essentially asking for
          reassurance]

(The planes are accumulating acceleration)

MAN        Take care of the Princess!
UNCLE     Take care of the rest!  [A common farewell phrase]
--------------------------------

(Airborne; aboard the Valley's towed barge)

GOLL      Is Pejite any closer? [LT: Pejite not yet?]
UNCLE     My hip [LT: area covering waist and hip] is hurting...
UNCLE     My, my, the Princess has really chosen those that won't be missed.
GOLL      Hey...  Don't you think this is strange?  Why are we flying in a
          swarm like this?
UNCLE     It's as if they fear an attack.

(Aboard a large transport ship)

NAUSICAA  Beneath the clouds is a terrible whirlpool of vapors.
NAUSICAA  ...?
GUARD     Don't move.

(A foreign gunship suddenly appears from the clouds above)

NAUSICAA  Gunship!!
VOICE     Enemy attack!  Ship number 2, destroyed!!

(On the barge)

UNCLE     Like I said!
UNCLE     How frightening!!

(The gunship is coming around for another attack)

VOICE     Perimeter defense!  It's a Pejite gunship!
NAUSICAA  Pejite!?
VOICE     Damn - ship number 3, destroyed as well!  What is the corvette
          doing?!
RADIO     (from ship number 3) "We can't steer!  We can't steer!"
MITO      What a fragile ship.  (Explosion)
VOICE     The rear-guard was caught up in it!

(The barge's tow-line snaps and the barge drifts away)

NAUSICAA  The barge's wire...!  Teto, hurry!
MITO      It's no use, this one'll fall, too!  Princess!

(Nausicaa climbs open to the transport's roof)

NAUSICAA  <Please> stop!  Don't kill any more!!
NAUSICAA  Stop!!  (The pilot hesitates and the gunship swerves.  It is hit and
          goes down)
MITO      Princess!

(The transport is on fire; Nausicaa and Mito make for the gunship in the cargo
hold)

NAUSICAA  Hurry, Mito!!
MITO      Ouch-ouch-ouch.  Princess!  It's useless!
NAUSICAA  We might be able to fly!
MITO      What?!
NAUSICAA  Mito!  Hurry!!
MITO      Y-Yes!!
NAUSICAA  Engine, start!  We'll blast the door with the gun!!
MITO      Yes!  (Nausicaa notices Kushana)
NAUSICAA  Come!  Quickly!!  (Kushana hesitates, then jumps aboard the gunship)
NAUSICAA  Quickly, get inside!  Mito, ready?!
MITO      Somehow!
NAUSICAA  Engine full at the same time as the blast <of the gun>!
MITO      Roger!
NAUSICAA  Ready!  Shoot!

(The gunship successfully leaves the burning transport)

NAUSICAA  Put on the masks!  We'll descend below the clouds and rescue the
          barge!
--------------------------------

(Beneath the cloud, above the Fukai)

NAUSICAA  <Still> warm...  Please don't die, Teto!
MITO      What a world <down there>!  I've never seen such dense a vapor [ALT:
          miasma] before!
NAUSICAA  Rear seat!  Attention to the right-rear direction!  It's near.  It's
          still flying!
MITO      It's true!  It really was there!!
UNCLE     It's the Princess!
GOLL      Princess!
NAUSICAA  Everyone!  Hang on!!  I'll extend the rope.
UNCLE     The hook is broken.  Aerial retrieval is impossible!
UNCLE     I don't want to make an emergency landing [ALT: forced landing] and
          be eaten by the bugs!!
UNCLE     I'll just die [ALT: I'll just kill myself] without any more ado!
MITO      Calm down!!  Throw out the baggage!!
UNCLE     Fare thee well!
MITO      Do as I say!!  Throw out the baggage!!
NAUSICAA  Rear seat! Cut the engine!!
MITO      W-What?!
NAUSICAA  The engine noise is distracting.  Hurry!!
MITO      Y-Yes! (Nausicaa stands up in the cockpit and removes her mask)
GOLL      P-Princess!  W-What...
UNCLE     Princess, your mask!!  You'll die!  Put on your mask!!
NAUSICAA  Everybody!  I'll save you for certain [ALT: sure]!  Believe me and
          throw out the baggage!
UNCLE     We'll do anything!  Please, hurry, put on your mask!
GOLL      The Princess is smiling.
UNCLE     We're going to be saved.
GOLL      Hurry!  Throw out the baggage!
MITO      The bow is falling!!
NAUSICAA  Ignite the engine!  We'll look for a place for emergency landing!  A
          little <of the vapor [ALT: miasma]>... got in my lungs...
--------------------------------

(The gunship and the trailer barge splash down onto a lake)

UNCLE     Princess!
NAUSICAA  Is everyone all right?
KUSHANA   Don't move!  (She points her gun)
MITO      You...!! ["Kisama"]
KUSHANA   Thanks for your labor a while back.
GOLL      Princess!  Why <did you save> such a one...?
KUSHANA   You're too naive. ["Amai"  ET: sweet, easy, simple, trusting]  Did
          you think I would get on my knees and thank you?
NAUSICAA  You haven't understood anything about the Fukai.  This is not a human
          world...  It's a place where you don't know what will happen if you
          use a gun.  Many ships fell to the forest from the battle a little
          while ago, and the insects are angry.  Look, above...  The royal
          Yanma is the sentinel [ET: watch] of the forest.  It will call [ALT:
          gather] the other insects immediately.  We must escape at once!
          <Bring out> the spare rope!
MEN       Y-Yes!
NAUSICAA  Mito!  Repair the hook!
MITO      Yes!  (Kushana shoots)
KUSHANA   Don't move!  I'll give the orders!
NAUSICAA  What are you frightened of?  You're like a lost fox-squirrel.
KUSHANA   WHAT!?
NAUSICAA  Don't be afraid...  I just want you to go back to your own country.
KUSHANA   You <bitch>...! ["Kisama"]  (The ship bobs up and down as waves form
          on the lake)
UNCLES    What is it?
NAUSICAA  They've come!  (Ohmu surface all around them)
NAUSICAA  Quiet!!  Don't anger them!
UNCLE     This is an Ohmu's nest!!
GOLL      We're surrounded...
NAUSICAA  They're investigating us...  Ohmu!  I'm sorry!  For disturbing your
          nest...  But, please understand!  We're not your enemies.  (An Ohmu
          extends his feelers, surrounding Nausicaa)
UNCLE     P-Princess!

(Nausicaa sees a vision of golden field and a large tree.  The Ohmu leave)

NAUSICAA  ..!!  That person is alive?  Wait!  Ohmu!!
GOLL      What's starting [ALT: happening]?!
UNCLE     The Ohmu's eyes are bright red.
GOLL      Princess!  What do you think you're doing with Mehve?
NAUSICAA  When the water calms down, lift off at once and wait in the upper
          sky!  If I'm not back in one hour, return to the valley!!
MITO      But!
UNCLE     Princess!  (Nausicaa flies off)
UNCLE     She's gone...
MITO      (To Kushana) You will give me that...  Well, everyone, let's do as
          the Princess instructed.  Princess...
--------------------------------

(The pilot of the downed-gunship is fighting a losing-battle with swarms of
ground insects)

PILOT     S-Shit!  (The pilot drops from the cliff, pursued by Hebikera, a
          flying insect.  Nausicaa saves the pilot from the closing jaws of the
          insect)
PILOT     You <are>...?
NAUSICAA  You've killed too many <insects>!  Neither the light bombs nor the
          insect-whistle will work anymore!

(The tail of the insect strikes Mehve.  They crash-land onto a patch of sand.
The pilot regains consciousness)

ASBEL     Quicksand!  D-Damn!
--------------------------------

(In the sky above Fukai)

UNCLE     It's already been 2 hours!
UNCLE     The insects have only increased.
UNCLES    Princess!  Princess!!
--------------------------------

(Golden field; a dream.  Young Nausicaa is gathering flowers)

JHIL      Nausicaa...  Nausicaa!  Come here...  Come here...!
NAUSICAA  Father...  Mother's here, too...  No...  I don't want to go that
          way...
NAUSICAA  Don't come!  There's nothing <here>.  Really there's nothing <here>!
          (An Ohmu larva appears)
NAUSICAA  Don't come out!
MAN       It's an Ohmu larva .
JHIL      So the tree was being infested, after all.  [This phrase can also be
          interpreted as "So she was possessed <by the bug> afterall".  It is
          my strong belief that it is the former, but it's hard to say for
          sure] Give it here, Nausicaa.
NAUSICAA  No.  It hasn't done anything wrong!
JHIL      People and insects can't live in the same world, child.
NAUSICAA  Please!  Don't kill it!!  Please ...

(She wakes)

NAUSICAA  Teto ...
NAUSICAA  A mysterious [ALT: strange; "fushigi na" ] place...  (The pilot,
          carrying Mehve, runs up to Nausicaa)
ASBEL     Hi!  I found it at last.  How do you feel?
NAUSICAA  Where are we?
ASBEL     First of all, let me thank you.  I'm Asbel of Pejite. Thanks for
          saving me.
NAUSICAA  I'm Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind...  Where is this place?
ASBEL     It's not surprising that you're amazed.  We're beneath the Fukai.
NAUSICAA  Beneath the Fukai?
ASBEL     Look.  We fell down from up there, with the sands.
NAUSICAA  ...!!  We don't have our masks on!
ASBEL     Yes, that's just it.  The air here is clean.  I was surprised, too...
          That there was a place like this under the Fukai.  What's the matter?
          (Nausicaa starts to walk away)
ASBEL     Nausicaa!  Don't go too far!  (She walks up to one of the fossilized
          tree)
NAUSICAA  What a magnificent tree...  It's still conducting water even though
          it has died...  (Sand-fragments fall from above.  She picks one up)
NAUSICAA  Just like the sand from the well...
NAUSICAA  The trees that fossilized crumbled, and is falling down...

(After a while, Asbel finds Nausicaa)

ASBEL     You're crying?
NAUSICAA  Yes...  I'm happy...
--------------------------------

(Later)

ASBEL     Rastel was my twin sister...  I wanted to be there for her <when she
          died>...
NAUSICAA  I'm sorry...  <That> I was delayed in telling you.
ASBEL     No...  I'm sorry.  I almost killed the person who observed my
          sister's death.  [ALT: who was by my sister's death bed] ["Mitoru" -
          To oversee death.  In Japan, as in other countries, observance of the
          death of those you love or related to is considered important.  Here,
          with Nausicaa observing the death of Asbel's sister in his place,
          Asbel "owes" Nausicaa somewhat]
NAUSICAA  No.
ASBEL     So... That thing is in the Valley of the Wind?
ASBEL     ...!!  Strange tasting nuts, aren't they?
NAUSICAA  They're called Chico nuts...  They're very nutritious.
ASBEL     Tastes aside, I want to eat a boot-full!
--------------------------------

(That night)

ASBEL     The reason for the birth of Fukai?  You're a person who thinks about
          strange things.
NAUSICAA  The trees of the Fukai were born to clean this world that humans have
          polluted.  They take the earth's poison into themselves, turn it into
          clean crystals, then die and become sands.  This underground cavern
          was created in that way.  The insects are protecting that forest.
ASBEL     If so, it seems like we have no choice but to die out.  We won't know
          how many thousands of years it would take - We can't keep living in
          fear of the vapor [ALT: miasma] and the insects.  At the ver least,
          we need a way to keep the Fukai's poison from spreading any more than
          it has.
NAUSICAA  You say the same thing as Kushana.
ASBEL     No!  We aren't planning to use the God Soldier in warfare!  Tomorrow,
          when you meet everyone, you'll understand!
NAUSICAA  Let's go to sleep...  Tomorrow...  we'll have to fly a lot...
--------------------------------

(Back in the Valley, where the God Soldier is being revived)

GUARD     Nothing unusual, sir.
KUROTOWA  Going smoothly?
GUARD     Yes, sir!  The upper-half has almost stabilized.
KUROTOWA  (to the God Soldier) Really, the more I look, the more adorable a
          monster you seem.  Even for a poor soldier like myself, the ambition
          that has been rusted for quite some time starts to throb.  Sheesh!
          It's laughing!  The likes of you should've slept underground 'til the
          end of time!
GUARD     Chief!  Her Highness' convoy was attacked by a Pejite rebel and,
          leaving only one corvette, have all been annihilated.
KUROTOWA  What happened to Her Highness!
GUARD     I'm told that her ship exploded in mid-air.
GUARDS    Chief!
KUROTOWA  The villagers haven't caught on yet...?
GUARD     No, sir!
KUROTOWA  Good!  I'll go at once.  As for the rest of you, continue the
          operation!
GUARDS    Yes, sir!
KUROTOWA  Is it luck that's finally come around to an unlucky commoner, or is
          it a snare of destruction?
--------------------------------

(On a hidden-stairwell in the castle)

BOY       Uncle Mito and the others have come back.
BOY       They're waiting for you at the Acid Sea, Master Yupa.
--------------------------------

(In the hull of the ancient ship near the Acid Sea)

MITO      We alone have returned <without the princess>...  [apologetic]
          [ALT: We had the nerve to return alone]
VOICE     No...  I'm glad no one's hurt.

(In one section of the hull,)

KUSHANA   <You say you're> setting me free?
YUPA      Won't you sink the God Soldier deep into the Acid Sea and return to
          your own country?  The <Torumekian> warriors who remain in the valley
          are few.  It would be easy to fight now, but there's no sense i
          increasing any more casualties.
KUSHANA   Neither fire nor water will work on that thing... Nor can you move it
          now, until it starts to walk...  Don't you understand?  There's no
          turning back.  Because of the fear that a foreign country might
          possess enormous power, I was ordered to conquer Pejite.  Now that
          the existence of the thing is known, the neighboring countries will
          soon be dispatching huge armies, one after the other.  There's only
          one path left to you <all>.  Revive the God Soldier, reject the
          intervention of the neighboring powers, and live with that thing!
          Look!  (Kushana unfastens some gadgetry to reveal her mechanical left
          hand)
YUPA      By an insect...?
KUSHANA   One who will be my husband will see yet more dreadful things.  Burn
          the Fukai!  Kill the insects!  Why do you hesitate to take back t
          human world?!  Take [ALT: Snatch] that thing <from us> as we took
          [ALT: snatched] it from Pejite.
YUPA      We will not revive the God Soldier!

(A child arrives at the door)

BOY       Emergency!!
BOY       Hey, give the password!
BOY       I'm in a hurry!
BOY       Wind!
BOY       VALLEY!!
BOY       OK.
BOY       A spore was left!
MITO      WHAT?!
BOY       They're giving off great vapors and it's becoming a huge commotion
          throughout the valley!
--------------------------------

(Outside the castle, a crowd has gathered)

VOICE     Hand them over!
VOICE     Hurry, hand them over!
VOICE     If we don't hurry, the whole valley will be annihilated!
VOICE     That's right!  Hand over the hand-hooks and flame- throwers!!
VOICE     It's growing rapidly!
GUARD     The tools for burning the spores could become weapons...  Giving them
          that <would be>...
KUROTOWA  It can't be helped.  Return all but the guns.
GUARD     Yes, sir!
GUARD     The corvette is departing.
KUROTOWA  Don't fail this time.  Gather all the remaining troops from Pejite
          and bring them to this valley.
GUARD     Yes, sir!
KUROTOWA  Geez, it's becoming troublesome...
MAN       Hurry! Hurry up!
--------------------------------

(At the Acid Sea, the gunship is about to leave)

GOLL      Please find the Princess.
YUPA      Take care of the valley.  Restrain yourselves until I return.
GOLL      Yes <we will>.
GOLL      We'll go to the valley.
--------------------------------

(In the fields)

MAN       It's no use!  The spore has spread this far.
MAN       It struck here, too!
WOMAN     Out of the way!
GUARD     What are you doing!
WOMAN     Here, too!
VOICE     Grandmother...
GRNDMOTHR We can only burn them...  This forest is lost.  If we hesitate, the
          whole valley will be swallowed up by the Fukai.
MAN       Isn't there anything that can be done...?  This forest has protected
          the reservoir for 300 years...
MAN       Damn... If only they hadn't come...  (Approaching the Valley,)
GOLL      It looks like it won't settle as it is [ALT: settle with just the
          burning of the forests].
          Let's go!
--------------------------------

(Near Pejite, Nausicaa and Asbel are riding tandem on Mehve)

ASBEL     You think so?  It looks the same as always to me.
NAUSICAA  No insects...  I wonder why?  My heart is pounding.
ASBEL     It's a little further.  If we cross those mountains, my people [ALT:
          friend.  "Nakama" encompasses the nuances of friends, allies,
          companions, those who aspire for the same thing] are there.
ASBEL     ...?!  It looks strange in Pejite's direction.  What's that haze?
NAUSICAA  ...!  Asbel, put on your mask!
ASBEL     Insects...!  <They're> dead...
NAUSICAA  We're going to Pejite!
ASBEL     Be careful!  Torumekian troops should be there.
--------------------------------

(Pejite is in ruins.  Nausicaa and Asbel walk through the city.  They find a
corpse of Ohmu that has penetrated the the ruined mass that was the wall)

NAUSICAA  Even an Ohmu...
ASBEL     <I can't believe> the Center Dome was broken [ALT: eaten] through...!
          It's the end of Pejite ...  Even if we annihilated the Torumekians,
          this is...
NAUSICAA  annihilated?  What do you mean, Asbel?  (They notice a plane)
NAUSICAA  It's a brig [ALT: transport ship].
ASBEL     It's my people's [ALT: friends'] ship!  It's coming down.  Let's go!

(The brig lands)

LEADER    Asbel!  You're alive!
ASBEL     What have you done?  We can't even reconstruct like this!
LEADER    You saw the city, I see.  Don't worry.  Even if it's swallowed by the
          Fukai, we can burn it away almost at once.
ASBEL     But the God Soldier isn't here.
LEADER    I know.  It's in the Valley of the Wind.
ASBEL     How <did you know>?
LEADER    We weren't playing, either.  We have already put plan number 2 into
          action.  By tonight, all of the Torumekian army in the Valley of the
          Wind will be destroyed.
ASBEL     What?!
NAUSICAA  Destroyed?  What are you going to do?
LEADER    Asbel, who is this?
ASBEL     Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  She saved my life.
LEADER    The Valley of the Wind...
NAUSICAA  Tell me!  What's happening?  Asbel!  You know, don't you?  Tell me!
ASBEL     We will make the insects...attack.
NAUSICAA  You were the one who made the insects attack Pejite?!  How can
          you...?
LEADER    We must take back the God Soldier before it's revived at any cost.
MAN       It's to protect the world...  Please understand.
NAUSICAA  So you'll kill the people of the valley in the process?!  Stop it!
          Stop it at once!  Please!
MAN       It's too late.
LEADER    No one can stop them once they've started to run.  Most of us were
          killed off by the Torumekians.  There's no other way left <for us>!

(Nausicaa tries to leave on Mehve)

LEADER    Hold her down!
NAUSICAA  Release me!  Let me go!!
LEADER    Even though it's tough right now, soon as we take back the God
          Soldier, we can burn the Fukai and take back the human world.
NAUSICAA  That's a lie!  You're the same as the Torumekians!!
LEADER    No!  They would only use it for destruction!
NAUSICAA  You drink the well-water, too, don't you?  Who do you think is
          purifying that water?  The lakes and rivers that humans have made
          into poisoned waters, the trees of Fukai are purifying.  You're
          saying you'll burn down those forests?  You're at fault for
          excavating the God Soldier!!  [ALT: It's your fault for excavating
          the God Soldier]
LEADER    Then, what should we do?!  Do as the Torumekians dictate?!
NAUSICAA  No, no!!  Asbel, tell them the reason why the Fukai was born!  That
          the insects are protecting the world...!  Asbel!  Please!!  (Asbel
          grabs the Leader's gun)
LEADER    What are you doing?
ASBEL     Don't move!  Let her go.
LEADER    Calm down, Asbel!
ASBEL     I'm serious!  Let her go!  Nausicaa!  Let everyone (in the Valley)
          know!  (Asbel is struck from behind and he goes down)
NAUSICAA  Asbel!!  Release me!!
--------------------------------

(Kushana has managed to escape and is returning to the Valley on foot.  She
sees the Valley in turmoil)

KUSHANA   Those fools...!
--------------------------------

(A mob is attacking the Torumekian soldiers and heading for the castle)

GOLL      We can't help what's already started.
UNCLE     <But> we were told to restrain ourselves...
KUROTOWA  Don't panic; go rescue the soldiers with tanks!
GUARD     Chief!  The last one went down.
KUROTOWA  Are they coming this way?
GUARD     I don't know.  The villagers are gathering.
KUROTOWA  Don't you hate it?  A forest or two, and they go blood-thirsty.  It's
          a repetition of Pejite.  (Kurotowa notices the uncles making for the
          castle gate)
KUROTOWA  They've taken the tank!
GOLL      Move it quickly!
UNCLE     Don't hassle me.
UNCLE     They're coming!!
GUARD     Forward!
GOLL      Hey, hey, hurry up.
UNCLE     I wonder if this is it?  Ah, it moved.
UNCLE     Which way are you going?!
GOLL      Go forward!  Forward!!
UNCLE     I KNOW.
KUROTOWA  Damn!  Send out all tanks!  (Kurotowa notices Kushana striding in)
KUROTOWA  <Wouldn't you know it,> she was alive...  It was but a brief dream...
          (snaps to attention)  Your Highness!
UNCLE     While we hold the enemy in check, take everyone and make refuge by
          the Acid Sea!
MAN       Understood!
MAN       Hold on until the Princess returns with the gunship!
MAN       Everybody, hurry.
MAN       Hurry up!
GOLL      Don't be slow.  Why don't you help too?
UNCLE     I have a bad back ["gikkuri-goshi": a bad hip; a failed spine to hip
          area].  They've come!  The tanks have come!
UNCLE     Quickly!
UNCLE     I know, already!
--------------------------------

(On board the Torumekian corvette)

LIEUTENNT There's no mistake?
GUARD     It's a Pejite brig.  I caught a glimpse of it beyond those clouds.
LIEUTENNT Good!
--------------------------------

(On the Pejite ship)

GUARD     Please be careful.  She was acting violently only a little while
          ago...
WOMAN     Hurry!
WOMAN     Miss Nausicaa, we'll get you out of here.  Go and let the Valley
          know...  There may still be time if you use your kite...  It's
          prepared.  I heard everything from Asbel.  [ALT: Asbel told us
          everything]
GIRL      I'll take your place, so hurry and take this...
NAUSICAA  You are...?
WOMAN     I'm Rastel's mother...
NAUSICAA  Mother...!
MOTHER    (Asbel's) I'm so sorry...  What we did was all wrong.
GIRL      Hurry!  (Nausicaa, wearing the other girl's dress, leaves with
          Asbel's mother)
NAUSICAA  That girl...?
MOTHER    It's all right; don't worry.

(In a storage section of the brig)

WOMAN     Be careful.
OLD WOMAN Please forgive <us for> the terrible treatment...
ASBEL     Nausicaa, over here!  Hurry!
NAUSICAA  Thank you, everyone!
ASBEL     Sorry I was late...

(In a cargo hold/hanger)

ASBEL     Can you fly from here?
NAUSICAA  I'll try.  (A corvette appears from the cloud)
NAUSICAA  A corvette!
LEADER    Retreat!  Hurry, into the clouds!!
LIEUTENNT Cease fire!  Fools!  It's air disturbance and electric hell within
          the clouds.
GUARD     (Pejite) It's no use!  We can't steer!
ASBEL     The ship is breaking up!
LEADER    Everyone!  It can't be helped.  Let's get out of the clouds and
          fight!

(The brig comes out of the cloud, but the corvette is waiting)

LEADER    They've anticipated us!  [ALT:  They've read our intention]
ASBEL     Damn.  What are they <Torumekians> intending to do?!
NAUSICAA  The clouds!  They're going to force us onto the clouds and board!
          (The corvette lands on top of the larger Pejite ship, and boarding
          parties enter)
ASBEL     They're coming!  If you're going to fly, now is the only time.
NAUSICAA  I can't do that!  I'll stay behind, too!  I can't just leave that
          girl who took my place or your mother behind and go!
ASBEL     Only you can save the people of the Valley!  Please, go!  Go for us!!

(There is fighting in the corridors)

GUARD     We'll take the ship.  Don't take prisoners.  Kill them all [?].
--------------------------------

(A man appears in the hatchway to the hold)

ASBEL     Go, Nausicaa!!  GO!!  (Nausicaa is pushed out by Asbel)
NAUSICAA  Asbel!!

(The corvette leaves the Pejite ship to chase Nausicaa.  Soon, the Valley
gunship appears)

MITO      Princess!!
NAUSICAA  Mito!  (Valley gunship shoots down the corvette)
NAUSICAA  Mito!  Master Yupa!!
MITO      Princess!!
NAUSICAA  Hurry!  Everyone <will be> [in ref to people of Pejite]...!
          Everyone <will be>!!
MITO      I'll extend the retrieval hook now!  Master Yupa!  <Pull> the red
          leve on the right!
--------------------------------

(Back aboard the Pejite ship)

GUARD     This is the only place left.  Hurry!
ASBEL     The door...is breaking!
LEADER    Let them come...  We'll show them the pride of Pejite!!
GIRL      I wonder what that is?  A bird...?
LOOKOUT   It's a ship!  A gunship from the Valley of the Wind!
GUARD     What!?

(Yupa lands)

GUARD     You <bastard>...! ["Kisama"]  (Three guards fall on Yupa, but he
          quick them)
LIEUTENNT It's Yupa!  Kill him and gain fame! [ALT: win fame; gain renown]
          (Yupa leaps over the guards and corners their lieutenant)
YUPA      Surrender!  The corvette will not be returning.
GUARD     S-Strong... [ALT: S-Skilled]
--------------------------------

(In the gunship)

MITO      Princess, this is ridiculous!  The engine will explode!
NAUSICAA  All it has to do is last until the Valley. [ALT: I don't care as long
          as it lasts to the Valley]  Raise it to 300!!  Dear God...!  Dear God
          of the Wind!  Please protect everyone.
--------------------------------

(The people of the Valley are holed up in the wreck of an ancient space ship;
the Torumekian army has them surrounded)

KUROTOWA  It doesn't seem like we can move them even with a lever...
KUSHANA   They're waiting for her return...
KUROTOWA  Return?
KUSHANA   They believe that that girl will return with the gunship.
KUROTOWA  The gunship would be troublesome...  Shall we start a round now
          <before the gunship returns>?
KUSHANA   Do you know what that ship is?
KUROTOWA  It was built before the Seven Days of Fire, right?  I don't know if
          it's true or not, but it <supposedly> went as far as the stars, or
          some such.  The guns don't work very well <against it> because it's
          extremely hard, but, heck, if we aim at [ALT: shoot in]  the holes...
KUSHANA   I want to wait as well.
KUROTOWA  Huh?
KUSHANA   If, that is, she can indeed return from the depth of the Fukai
          alive... I would have liked to have spoken with that girl once.

(She goes down to the Valley prisoners)

KUSHANA   Well?  Made up your minds?  If you're going to counsel surrender <to
          them> I'll release you.  Do you want this to be a repetition of
          Pejite?
UNCLE     You're a Princess, too, but you're very different from our
          Princess...
GOLL      Please look at this hand.  It's the same disease as Lord Jhil's.  In
          half a year, it'll be just like a rock.  But, our Princess says she
          likes this hand.  She told me it was the beautiful hand of a hard-
          working person.
KUSHANA   Even while being affected by the poisons of the Fukai, you
          nonetheless say you will live with the Fukai?
UNCLE     You use fire...  We use a little of that, too, but...
GOLL      Too much fire gives birth to nothing...  Fire turns a forest to ash
          in one day...
UNCLE     Water and wind takes 100 years to nurture a forest.  We prefer water
          and wind...
UNCLE     If the Princess saw that forest, she would grieve...
GUARD     Chief.  Any orders yet?
KUROTOWA  Mind your business... [ALT: Stay down; stay away; go away]
GUARD     Yes, sir!
KUROTOWA  I don't know what happened, but, my, you've turned soft-hearted.
          [ALT: cute(well...); manageable]
KUSHANA   Kurotowa!  Release those people!
KUROTOWA  Then we're going to wait?
KUSHANA   Let the troops take their meal!  In one hour we'll begin the attack!
KUROTOWA  A meal, eh...?  I guess I'll take my time with it...

(Later)

MAN       Somebody's coming!
MAN       It's Goll and the others!
GOLL      Hm?
UNCLE     What's the matter...?
GOLL      There's no wind...
UNCLE     No wind?  You're right...  The wind has stopped...
GRNDMOTHR Oh...
GIRL      Grandmother, what's the matter?
WOMAN     Grandmother?
GRNDMOTHR Somebody...  Somebody take me outside...!

(On the hull of the ancient ship)

GIRL      This is the first time the wind ever stopped...
GIRL      Grandmother, my ears hurt...
GRNDMOTHR The atmosphere...  The atmosphere is filled with anger...
--------------------------------

(Aboard the gunship)

NAUSICAA  <We're> close!
MITO      We've cut through the Fukai!  Three minutes to the Acid Sea!
NAUSICAA  Engine, slow!  We'll descend beneath the clouds.
MITO      What are these lights?!
NAUSICAA  Ohmu...!
MITO      The Ohmu have flooded out of the Fukai!!  They're heading for the
          Valley of the Wind!
NAUSICAA  Why?  How did they get the Ohmu to <stampede>...?
NAUSICAA  ..!!  Someone is calling the herd...  Mito!  Fly towards Sirius!
MITO      Y-Yes.
NAUSICAA  There!  Mito, a flare!  Ready...  Fire!

(A small Ohmu is being carried through the air)

MITO      What is that!?
NAUSICAA  How cruel...!  They're using that child as a lure to call the herds.
MITO      Damn!!  I'll knock them down!
NAUSICAA  No!!  Don't shoot!  Mito, please!!
MITO      Why!  Why can't I shoot them down?!
NAUSICAA  If we kill the Ohmu's child, we won't be able to stop the stampede!!
MITO      Then what can we do?!  As it stands, the Valley will be annihilated!!
NAUSICAA  Calm down, Mito!  We'll return the Ohmu's child to the herd.  I'll
          try it!
MITO      Princess, what are you doing?!
NAUSICAA  Mito, you go let everyone know!  (Nausicaa leaves on Mehve)
MITO      Princess!!  Without even a weapon...!
--------------------------------

(Back in the Valley)

GUARD     Those are not our flares!
KUSHANA   Distance?!
GUARD     About 20 leagues.  I speculate that it is on the other side of the
          lake.
KUSHANA   Do you think it's the gunship?
KUROTOWA  Most likely...  It's a signal requesting help.  It's definitely the
          gun ship.
KUSHANA   One hour has passed.  Let's go.
KUROTOWA  You won't wait?
KUSHANA   It's a bloody path, after all.
GUARD     Armored troops, forward!
KUROTOWA  Your Highness, <won't you go> inside?
KUSHANA   Here is fine.
GUARD     The gunship!
GUARD     Air raid!
KUSHANA   Don't shoot!!  Stop.  Stop it!
GOLL      Princess!!
KUSHANA   Await orders here!  Hold your fire!!
KUROTOWA  Your Highness!

(The gunship lands)

KUSHANA   What happened to that girl?!
GOLL      Where's the Princess!?
UNCLE     She's not riding in the back!
MITO      It's the Ohmu!  A herd of Ohmu is coming this way!
GOLL      What?
MAN       Ohmu?
MITO      The Princess stayed behind alone to stop the stampede.  There's no
          time for fighting!  Everyone, escape to high ground!  Hurry!!

(Atop the wreck, looking on)

GIRL      Grandmother, I can see red lights!
GIRL      It looks like they're multiplying rapidly...
GIRL      They're coming this way!
GRNDMOTHR Hang on tight to Grandma...  No one can stop them now...
VOICES    Don't panic!!  It's still all right!  Hurry!
OLD WOMAN Mito...  I'm going to die anyway; I'll die in the valley.
MITO      No.  While the Princess hasn't given up, don't give up.

(Kushana is addressing her troops)

KUSHANA   All right?  Gain as much time as you can.  I will return shortly.
KUROTOWA  Your Highness!  Are you considering that thing...?  It's too soon.
KUSHANA   If we don't use it now, when do we use it?  Go!
--------------------------------

(Nausicaa is circling the Pejite 'flying jar')

NAUSICAA  Don't shoot!  Hear me out!
MAN       Damn...  That one's like a bird!
GUNNER    That person's not an enemy.  She was crying out something.
MAN       Anyone who hinders the plan is an enemy.  If we don't drop the lure
          in the valley soon, it'll be us who are in danger. [ALT: we will be
          in danger] She's coming...  Draw her in real close before you fire.
          Now!  Shoot!!
GUNNER    No!!  That's Rastel's <clothes>...
MAN       Move!

(Nausicaa leaps from Mehve into the flying jar.  The operation is disrupted and
the flying jar loses altitude.  The Ohmu larva lands and pulls the vehicle
down.  Nausicaa heads for the injured larva)

NAUSICAA  Ohmu...
NAUSICAA  Don't be angry...  Don't be frightened...  I'm not your enemy...  I'm
          sorry...  I'm so sorry...  I can't ask you to forgive us, can I...?
          It was too cruel, wasn't it...?  (The Ohmu larva, sensing the
          approach of the herd, starts forward)
NAUSICAA  You mustn't move!!  Your body fluid's going to flow!!
MAN       Oh no! [ALT: Oh my god] We've been found! [ALT: They found us]
GUNNER    They're coming this way!

(The Ohmu larva tries to cross the lake to rejoin the herd)

NAUSICAA  Don't!  If you go in with a wound like that...!  This lake water is
          no good, I tell you!  (Nausicaa's foot enters the water and is burned
          the acid)
NAUSICAA  AHHH!!  (The Ohmu larva lifts her away from the lake.  It extends its
          feelers to comfort Nausicaa)
NAUSICAA  You...  [pause]  Kind child...  I'm all right...  Soon everyone will
          be here to take you back...  (Ohmu herd that was heading toward the
          larva now turns away)
NAUSICAA  They're not coming this way!  Ohmu!  Don't!  The Valley of the Wind
          lies that way!!  In anger they've forgotten themselves.  If I can
          calm them, the Valley will be...!!

(Rockets are being launched from the Valley)

MAN       Fools!  They're gathering the Ohmu themselves!
GUNNER    We're saved...
MAN       Let's take off at once.  Check the engine...  [pause] S-stop!

(Nausicaa has dismounted the flying jar's machine gun)

MAN       We can explain!
NAUSICAA  Carry us...  I will return that child to the herd!
MAN       It's no use <doing a thing like that>.  The herd won't stop!
NAUSICAA  You'll only have to drop [ALT: unload] us in front of the herd.
          Carry us!
GUNNER    But...  You'll die, too!
--------------------------------

(Acid Sea)

GIRL      Will everyone die, Grandmother?
GRNDMOTHR If that is our destiny...we can only obey.
KUROTOWA  Haven't budged at all!
GUARD     Let's retreat, sir.
KUROTOWA  Idiot.  You talk about escaping but...where do we escape to?  (The
          soldiers loses heart and a mass desertion is about to begin)
KUROTOWA  Hey!  Don't run away!  Wait!  Hey!  Stand your ground until Her
          Highness returns!  Her Highness...  (Kushana arrives) It's Her
          Highness!!

(The God Soldier appears behind Kushana)

PEOPLE    It's the God Soldier!
KUROTOWA  It's spoiled [ALT: rotting]...  It was too early.
KUSHANA   Burn them down!!  What's the matter...?!  Are you not the descendent
          of the most evil clan <ever to live> on earth?!

(The God Soldier opens fire on the Ohmu; Tremendous explosion follows)

KUROTOWA  Amazing...  No wonder the world was burned!
GUARD     Her Highness Kushana...  Hooray!  Hooray!
KUSHANA   Burn them down!  What's the matter, monster?   Shoot at once!

(The God Soldier begins to disintegrate and collapses)

GIRL      The God Soldier died...
GRNDMOTHR It's better that way.  The anger of the Ohmu is the anger of the
          earth.  Of what use is surviving, relying on a thing like that?

(Nausicaa is carried in with the small Ohmu)

GIRL      Princess !!  It's Princess!
VILLAGERS Princess.  Princess...!

(The flying jar drops Nausicaa and the Ohmu larva)

MAN       A place like that...!
MAN       That's crazy...
WOMAN     Princess!

(The stampede arrives, and Nausicaa's body is tossed into the air)
--------------------------------

(The Pejite brig, as it approaches the Valley)

YUPA      The Ohmu's attack color is going out...!
--------------------------------

(Acid Sea)

GRNDMOTHR The anger has disappeared from the atmosphere...
MITO      They've stopped... .  The Ohmu have stopped.
GIRL      Princess!!
GIRL      Princess is dead...
GRNDMOTHR She has quieted the Ohmu's anger with her own body [ET:  life]...
          That child has protected the Valley...  (An Ohmu lifts Nausicaa's
          body on its feelers; other Ohmu join in)
MAN       Look!
KUROTOWA  What are these lights...?

(There is a great coalescence of light.  Nausicaa regains consciousness [or
resurrected, whichever you prefer])

NAUSICAA  Teto...  I'm glad...  Ohmu, thank you...  Thank you...!
GOLL      It's a miracle...  It's a miracle!
GRNDMOTHR What sympathy they possess...!  The Ohmu are opening their hearts...
          Children, look well <for me> in place of my blind eyes.
GIRL      Princess is wearing a deep blue foreign dress.
GIRL      It's as if she's walking through a golden field...
GRNDMOTHR "That one, wearing a robe of blue, shall descend onto a golden
          field..."  Oh...!!
GIRL      Grandmother?
GRNDMOTHR The old legend was indeed true...!
GIRL      Look!
MAN       It's Mehve!
MAN       The wind...!  The wind has come back!

(The people run to meet Nausicaa.  Scenes of what happens afterwards follow.
Nausicaa's mask lies near a new sapling growing in the cavern below the Fukai)

THE END
